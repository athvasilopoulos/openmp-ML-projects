# OpenMP ML Projects

This repository contains three algorithms/problems in both their serial and parallel form, using OpenMP. These exercises where completed during the "Parallel Programming in ML" ECE course.

## 1. K-means

Both versions of this algorithm execute 16 steps from the K-means algorithm, on randomly created data. The time of execution and instructions for compiling for each version are written inside the source code files.

## 2. Travelling Salesman Problem

I developed three different algorithms for a large TSP problem (10K nodes).
<ol type="a">
  <li>Random Swap Algorithm</li>
  <li>Modified Heinritz-Hsiao (Nearest Neighbour) Algorithm</li>
  <li>Ant System Algorithm (as depicted <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18263004/">here</a>)</li>
</ol>
The time of execution, instructions for compiling and the results for each version are written inside the source code files.

## 3. Error Backpropagation

For this algorithm, I trained a Neural Network to determine the type of clothing from photos, using data from Kaggle. For more information about the data or the problem in general, visit <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist/data">Fashion MNIST</a> on Kaggle.<br>
The time of execution, instructions for compiling and the accuracy are written inside the source code files.
